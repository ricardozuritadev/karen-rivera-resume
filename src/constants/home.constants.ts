            SINGING:
                "While I am an amateur singer, I know that every tone and note matters. The same is true in my work. Every pixel counts, every interaction is an opportunity to create a harmonious experience. I design interfaces like someone who composes a melody: with passion, attention to detail and an ear always attentive to the user's needs.",
            MOVING: "Whether it's the gym or dance in the living room, moving daily, sweating and pushing myself is part of my weeks. I feel that every project is like a choreography and every step counts to create a fluid and dynamic experience. From the first sketches to the final prototypes, I work with the same energy and precision that I put into every workout and dance.",
            READING:
                "I became a passionate reader after falling for the power of good storytelling. Since then, I not only create interfaces, but I build visual narratives that guide the user through an immersive and meaningful experience. Every screen is a page and every interaction a chapter that keeps the user engaged and satisfied.",
            PEOPLE: "Spending time with friends and family is one of my sources of inspiration. The human connections and shared experiences teach me about empathy, communication and collaboration, essential elements in UX UI design. I value every moment with them, and that is reflected in my dedication to creating interfaces that facilitate meaningful connections for all users."
